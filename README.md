Hey there! 👋 This is a beautiful, interactive filament color browser for [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/) - the awesome open-source filament inventory management system. 

Think of it as your personal filament showroom - browse colors, filter by material, vendor, location, and find that perfect filament for your next print! 🖨️✨

> **Note:** This is a companion app for Spoolman. You'll need a running [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/) instance to manage your filaments, or you can browse the external community database without Spoolman.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Want to see it in action? Check out the live demo:

**🚀 [https://spoolswatch.disane.dev/](https://spoolswatch.disane.dev/)**

> [!NOTE]
> On first visit, you'll need to enter your Spoolman server URL. The app stores this in your browser's local storage - we don't collect or store anything on our servers!

## ✨ What Can This Thing Do?

Glad you asked! Here's the good stuff:

- 🎨 **Beautiful Color Display**: See your filaments with their actual colors in a stunning grid or carousel view
- 🎨 **Color Values**: View HEX and RGB values for easy color matching across tools
- 🔍 **Smart Filtering**: Filter by vendor, material, color type (single/multi-color), location, and source
- 📍 **Location Tracking**: See exactly where your spools are stored
- ⚖️ **Remaining Weight**: Track how much filament you have left on each spool
- 🌈 **Multi-Color Support**: Full support for multi-color filaments with visual indicators
- 🎯 **Color Palette**: Click through an interactive color map to find specific colors
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🌍 **Multi-Language**: Available in English and German
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose your preferred theme
- 🔖 **Pin Favorites**: Create a custom palette by pinning your favorite filaments
- 🔗 **Deep Linking**: Share searches with URL parameters (e.g., `?v=prusament&m=petg`)
- 💾 **Local First**: All settings stored in your browser - no cloud, no tracking
- 🚀 **External Database**: Browse filaments from the community database even without Spoolman
- 📦 **Projects** *(Beta)*: Import 3D print files (.3MF, .gcode), track filament usage by print, view thumbnails and 3D previews, calculate costs per filament, per plate, and total

> **Beta Feature**: The Projects feature is currently in beta. It allows you to import 3D print files, automatically detect filament colors, match them with your Spoolman inventory, and track total costs. This feature is experimental and may change based on user feedback.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using the live version is super easy:

1. Visit **[https://spoolswatch.disane.dev/](https://spoolswatch.disane.dev/)**
2. Enter your Spoolman server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7912`)
3. Start browsing your filaments! 🎉

> [!TIP]
> The URL is only stored in your browser's local storage. You can change it anytime by clicking the edit button in the footer.

### ⚠️ CORS Configuration Required

When using the deployed version (not localhost), you need to configure CORS on your Spoolman server to allow requests from `https://spoolswatch.disane.dev`.

**Add this to your Spoolman configuration:**

```env
SPOOLMAN_CORS_ORIGIN=spoolswatch.disane.dev
```

For multiple origins (comma-separated, **NO SPACES**):

```env
SPOOLMAN_CORS_ORIGIN=spoolswatch.disane.dev,localhost:5173
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do NOT include the protocol (`https://` or `http://`). Use only the domain: `spoolswatch.disane.dev` NOT `https://spoolswatch.disane.dev`

**Where to add this:**
- **Docker**: Add to your `docker-compose.yml` under `environment:` or in your `.env` file
- **Direct installation**: Add to your `.env` file in the Spoolman directory

**After changing the configuration, you MUST restart Spoolman:**
- Docker: `docker-compose restart` or `docker restart spoolman`
- Direct: Restart the Spoolman service

> [!NOTE]
> This is only required when accessing the app from a different domain than your Spoolman server. Local development automatically uses a proxy to avoid CORS issues.

#### 🔧 Troubleshooting CORS Issues

If you still get CORS errors after configuring `SPOOLMAN_CORS_ORIGIN`:

1. **Verify Spoolman was restarted**: `docker logs spoolman | grep CORS` should show your origins
2. **Check for typos**: No spaces, correct protocol (`https://` vs `http://`)
3. **Verify the ENV variable is loaded**: `docker exec spoolman env | grep CORS`

**Alternative Solutions:**

- **Use the `surl` parameter**: Share links like `https://spoolswatch.disane.dev/?surl=http://your-spoolman:7912`
- **Self-host this app**: Clone and deploy it on the same domain as your Spoolman instance
- **Use a reverse proxy**: Configure nginx/traefik to serve both Spoolman and this app from the same domain
- **Browser extension**: Use a CORS unblock extension (not recommended for security reasons)

**If CORS configuration doesn't work**, the most reliable solution is to self-host this app or use the local development version.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally

Want to run it on your own machine? No problem!

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Disane87/spoolman-filament-swatch.git
cd spoolman-filament-swatch

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎯 Features in Detail

### 📊 Two View Modes

- **Board View**: Grid layout showing all filaments at once - perfect for getting an overview
- **Carousel View**: Swipeable cards with detailed information - great for browsing one-by-one

### 🔍 Powerful Filtering

- **Search**: Type to search by name, vendor, material, or color code
- **Vendor**: Filter by manufacturer (Prusament, eSUN, etc.)
- **Material**: Filter by type (PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU, etc.)
- **Color Type**: Show only single-color or multi-color filaments
- **Location**: See filaments at specific storage locations
- **Source**: Toggle between Spoolman spools and external database
- **Color Palette**: Click on any color in the palette to filter

### 🎨 Color Map

The color map shows all unique colors in your collection, sorted by brightness. Click any color to filter your filaments - perfect for finding that exact shade you need!

### 📍 Location Awareness

If you track spool locations in Spoolman, you'll see:
- All locations where a filament is stored
- Total remaining weight across all spools of that filament
- Number of spools available

### 🔖 Pin Your Favorites

Building a custom palette? Pin your favorite filaments and they'll be collected in a convenient drawer:
- Click the pin icon on any filament card
- View all pinned items in the palette drawer
- Scroll to pinned items in the board view
- Clear all pins with one click

### 🌐 External Database

Don't have Spoolman yet? No worries! The app includes access to a community database of filaments. You can browse colors and specifications even without connecting to a Spoolman instance.

## 🔗 URL Parameters

Share specific searches with these URL parameters:

- `?q=search+term` - Pre-fill search
- `?v=vendor` - Pre-select vendor (e.g., `?v=prusament`)
- `?m=material` - Pre-select material (e.g., `?m=petg`)
- `?c=%23ff0000` - Pre-select color (URL-encoded hex)
- `?l=location` - Pre-select location
- `?surl=http://your-server:7912` - Set Spoolman URL (overrides saved URL)

Combine multiple parameters:
```
https://spoolswatch.disane.dev/?surl=http://spoolman.local:7912&v=prusament&m=petg
```

> [!TIP]
> Use the `surl` parameter to share direct links to your Spoolman instance with specific filters!
